* ob-typst -- Org babel file for typst
Org babel for typst. It can generate image or pdf, and inserts link to them.

** Installation

#+begin_src elisp
  (leaf ob-typst
    :el-get Cj-bc/ob-typst)
#+end_src

** Basic usage
Write typst in code block

#+begin_src typst
#set text(fill: white, size: 25pt)

 = Hello!
 This is sample typst snippet with formula $y = x^2 + 2x + 3$.
#+end_src

Calling ~C-c C-c~ (~org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c~) on it converts it into image,
saves to temporary file, and inserts link to it.

If you are using ~png~ or ~svg~, you can press ~C-c C-x C-v~
(~org-toggle-inline-images~) to preview image in the buffer.

** Features
*** Output to specified file
You can specify file name for the generated image/pdf by ~:outfile~ argument:

#+begin_src typst :outfile sample.png :exports both
  = Hello Sample file!

  This file should be at _sample.png_
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:sample.png]]
*** Default page rule when nothing is specified
You can define default [[https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/page/][page rule]] (defines page size, etc)
~ob-typst/default-page-rule~ that will be automatically inserted when
none page rule is written in the snippet.

By default, ~width~ and ~height~ are auto so that it won't be too big.
